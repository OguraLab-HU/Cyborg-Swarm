This program simulates a leader-follower swarm control system involving 20 cyborgs. It features one leader and 19 followers navigating to a predefined goal.

Program Overview

Leader Control: The leader continuously moves towards the goal, guiding the followers.
Follower Control: Follower movement is determined by the TGI control algorithm and random motion.

Features

Swarm Initialization: Randomly position 19 followers with the leader starting near the center.
Leader Control: The leader continuously moves towards the goal, guiding the followers.
Follower Control: Follower movement is determined by the TGI control algorithm and random motion.
Animation Output: Generates a video (animation.mp4) to visualize swarm behavior.

Requirements

MATLAB for running the script.
VideoWriter support for video output.
